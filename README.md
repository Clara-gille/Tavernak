# Tavernak
Tavernak is an FPS game based on exploring and cooking. You play as a tavern owner in a medieval fantastic world. This project was made to validate my Unity unit. The gameplay loop is in two parts :

In the morning, you have to explore the dangerous outside world. The goal is to collect as much ingredients as you can in the limited time. You can collect either fruits or mushrooms on the ground, or slay deers and dragons with your bow or your sword to collect their meat.

In the afternoon, you are back in your beautiful tavern. The objective there is to use the ingredients you collected to cook meals to your custumers. They have very mysterious and specific needs that need specific ingredients to be fulfilled. If you don't have enough money at the end of the day to pay the rent, the game is lost.
